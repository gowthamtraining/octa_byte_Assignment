# Technical Documentation: Portfolio Dashboard

## Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture with:

1. **Frontend**: Next.js application with React components
2. **Backend**: Node.js API routes within Next.js
3. **Data Sources**: Yahoo Finance and Google Finance (unofficial APIs)

## Key Decisions

1. **Data Fetching Strategy**:
   - Used unofficial Yahoo Finance and Google Finance APIs
   - Implemented client-side caching to reduce API calls
   - Added error handling for API failures

2. **State Management**:
   - Used React's built-in state management (useState, useEffect)
   - Considered using a state management library but kept it simple for this scope

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implemented caching in the backend API
   - Used memoization for expensive calculations
   - Debounced rapid API calls

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful error states in the UI
   - Automatic retry mechanism
   - Clear error messages for users

## Challenges Faced

1. **API Limitations**:
   - Unofficial APIs can break without warning
   - Rate limiting issues
   - Data format inconsistencies

**Solutions**:
   - Implemented caching to reduce API calls
   - Added fallback mechanisms when APIs fail
   - Used robust error handling

2. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Needed to balance freshness with performance
   - Potential for memory leaks with frequent updates

**Solutions**:
   - Used `setInterval` with proper cleanup
   - Considered WebSockets but kept it simple with polling

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Raw API data needed significant processing
   - Different formats from different sources

**Solutions**:
   - Created unified data models
   - Implemented transformation functions
   - Added type safety with TypeScript

## Future Improvements

1. Implement WebSockets for more efficient real-time updates
2. Add user authentication and portfolio customization
3. Include charts and visualizations for better data representation
4. Add more robust error handling and fallback data sources
5. Implement server-side rendering for better initial load performance
